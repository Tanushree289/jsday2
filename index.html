 <h3>1.Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()</h3>
<pre>call() - It invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments one by one.
    ex - const person = {
        firstName:"John",
        lastName: "Doe",
        fullName: function () {
          return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
        }
      }
      
      person.fullName();  
      
    apply() - It invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments as an array.
    ex - const person = {
        fullName: function() {
          return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
        }
      }
      
      const person1 = {
        firstName: "Mary",
        lastName: "Doe"
      }
      person.fullName.apply(person1);
    
    
    
    bind() - I t returns a new function, allowing you to pass in a this array and any number of arguments.
    ex - const person = {
        firstName:"John",
        lastName: "Doe",
        fullName: function () {
          return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
        }
      }
      const member = {
        firstName:"Hege",
        lastName: "Nilsen",
      }
      let fullName = person.fullName.bind(member);</pre>


  <h3>2.What are objects in javascript?</h3>
<p>Object is a non-primitive data-type that allows us to store multiple collections of data in the form of keyvalue pairs.
</p>

<h3>3.What are function constructors?</h3>
<pre>
    A constructor is a special function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class. 
It is a constructor gets called when an object is created using the new keyword. 
The purpose of a constructor is to create a new object and set values for any existing object
 properties.
ex - const sum = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');
console.log(sum(2, 6));
</pre>

<h3>4.Explain prototypes</h3>
<pre>
    The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default.
ex - const parentObject={

name:"Rakesh",
age:23,


}
var childObect=Object.create(parentObject)
console.log(parentObject.name);
console.log(childObect.name);

</pre>

<h3>5.What is prototype chain</h3>
<p>
    In prototype chain each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype. <br>
That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. <br>
</p>

<h3>6.Give an example of inheritance using function constructor</h3>
<p>
    Inheritance is a useful feature that allows code reusability. In the above example, <br>
the Student class inherits all the methods and properties of the Person class. <br>
Hence, the Student class will now have the name property and the greet() method. <br>
</p>

<h3>7.What are callbacks?</h3>
<pre>
    A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function.
ex- function greeting(name) {
  alert('Hello ' + name);
}

function processUserInput(callback) {
  var name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
  callback(name);
}

processUserInput(greeting);
</pre>

<h3>8.What is the use of setTimeout</h3>
<p>
    It sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code once the timer expires. <br>
Syntax: setTimeout(function, time);

</p>
<h3>9.What is an event loop and call stack</h3>
<p>
    Event loop - It is responsible for exceuting the code, collecting and processing events, and <br>
exceuting queued sub - tasks. <br>
Call stack - It is a mechanism for interpreter to keep track of multiple function call.
